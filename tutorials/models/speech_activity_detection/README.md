  Title = {{Speaker Change Detection in Broadcast TV using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks}},

## Databases
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

```bash
$ source activate pyannote
$ pip install pyannote.db.odessa.ami
$ pip install pyannote.db.musan
```

This tutorial relies on the [AMI](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus) and [MUSAN](http://www.openslr.org/17/) databases. We first need to tell `pyannote` where the audio files are located:

```bash
$ cat ~/.pyannote/database.yml
Databases:
  AMI: /path/to/ami/amicorpus/*/audio/{uri}.wav
  MUSAN: /path/to/musan/{uri}.wav
```

Have a look at `pyannote.database` [documentation](http://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-database) to learn how to use other datasets.


## Configuration
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

To ensure reproducibility, `pyannote-speech-detection` relies on a configuration file defining the experimental setup:

```bash
$ cat tutorials/models/speech_activity_detection/config.yml
```
```yaml
task:
   name: SpeechActivityDetection
   params:
      duration: 2.0      # sequences are 2s long
      batch_size: 64     # 64 sequences per batch
      per_epoch: 1       # one epoch = 1 day of audio

data_augmentation:
   name: AddNoise                                   # add noise on-the-fly
   params:
      snr_min: 10                                   # using random signal-to-noise
      snr_max: 20                                   # ratio between 10 and 20 dBs
      collection: MUSAN.Collection.BackgroundNoise  # use background noise from MUSAN
                                                    # (needs pyannote.db.musan)
feature_extraction:
   name: LibrosaMFCC      # use MFCC from librosa
   params:
      e: False            # do not use energy
      De: True            # use energy 1st derivative
      DDe: True           # use energy 2nd derivative
      coefs: 19           # use 19 MFCC coefficients
      D: True             # use coefficients 1st derivative
      DD: True            # use coefficients 2nd derivative
      duration: 0.025     # extract MFCC from 25ms windows
      step: 0.010         # extract MFCC every 10ms
      sample_rate: 16000  # convert to 16KHz first (if needed)

architecture:
   name: StackedRNN
   params:
      instance_normalize: True  # normalize sequences
      rnn: LSTM                 # use LSTM (could be GRU)
      recurrent: [128, 128]     # two layers with 128 hidden states
      bidirectional: True       # bidirectional LSTMs
      linear: [32, 32]          # add two linear layers at the end 

scheduler:
   name: CyclicScheduler        # use cyclic learning rate (LR) scheduler
   params:
      learning_rate: auto       # automatically guess LR upper bound
      epochs_per_cycle: 14      # 14 epochs per cycle
```

## Training
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

The following command will train the network using the training set of AMI database for 1000 epochs:

```bash
$ export EXPERIMENT_DIR=tutorials/models/speech_activity_detection
$ pyannote-speech-detection train --gpu --to=1000 ${EXPERIMENT_DIR} AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset
```

This will create a bunch of files in `TRAIN_DIR` (defined below).
One can follow along the training process using [tensorboard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard).
```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir=${EXPERIMENT_DIR}
```

## Validation
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

To get a quick idea of how the network is doing during training, one can use the `validate` mode.
It can (should!) be run in parallel to training and evaluates the model epoch after epoch.

```bash
$ export TRAIN_DIR=${EXPERIMENT_DIR}/train/AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset.train
$ pyannote-speech-detection validate ${TRAIN_DIR} AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset
```

In practice, it is tuning a simple speech activity detection pipeline (pyannote.audio.pipeline.speech_activity_detection.SpeechActivityDetection) after each epoch and stores the best hyper-parameter configuration on disk:

```bash
$ cat ${TRAIN_DIR}/validate/AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset/params.yml
```
```yaml
epoch: 280
params:
  min_duration_off: 0.0
  min_duration_on: 0.0
  offset: 0.5503037490496294
  onset: 0.5503037490496294
  pad_offset: 0.0
  pad_onset: 0.0
```

One can also use [tensorboard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard) to follow the validation process.

## Application
([↑up to table of contents](#table-of-contents))

Now that we know how the model is doing, we can apply it on all files of the AMI database and store raw SAD scores in `/path/to/precomputed/sad`:

```bash
$ pyannote-speech-detection apply ${TRAIN_DIR}/weights/0280.pt AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset /path/to/precomputed/sad
```

We can then use these raw scores to perform actual speech activity detection, and [`pyannote.metrics`](http://pyannote.github.io/pyannote-metrics/) to evaluate the result:

```python
# AMI protocol
>>> from pyannote.database import get_protocol
>>> protocol = get_protocol('AMI.SpeakerDiarization.MixHeadset')

# precomputed scores
>>> from pyannote.audio.features import Precomputed
>>> precomputed = Precomputed('/path/to/precomputed/sad')

# scores binarizer
>>> from pyannote.audio.signal import Binarize
# onset / offset are tunable parameters (and should be tuned for better performance)
# we use log_scale = True because of the final log-softmax in the StackedRNN model
>>> binarize = Binarize(onset=0.55, offset=0.55, log_scale=True)

# evaluation metric
>>> from pyannote.metrics.detection import DetectionErrorRate
>>> metric = DetectionErrorRate()

# loop on test files
>>> from pyannote.database import get_annotated
>>> for test_file in protocol.test():
...    # load reference annotation
...    reference = test_file['annotation']
...    uem = get_annotated(test_file)
...
...    # load precomputed SAD scores as pyannote.core.SlidingWindowFeature
...    sad_scores = precomputed(test_file)
...
...    # binarize scores to obtain speech regions as pyannote.core.Timeline
...    speech_regions = binarize.apply(sad_scores, dimension=1)
...
...    # evaluate speech activity detection
...    metric(reference, speech_regions.to_annotation(), uem=uem)

>>> print(f'Detection error rate = {100*abs(metric):.1f}%')
```

That's all folks!
